Encrypt YouTube videos using XOR and hash

## Introduction
The idea is to store videos on youtube using XOR and hash for the frames and audio. Since the encrypted file is still video and audio, its impossible to tell if its just a useless upload or an encrypted video. This will make Google's ML algorithms useless for automatic detection unless, ofcourse, they try to put their machines to good use brute forcing the hashes(good luck with that).
